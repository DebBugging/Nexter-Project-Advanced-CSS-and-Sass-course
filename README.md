# Nexter -Advanced CSS and Sass course

---

### Project Overview

This is the final project in Udemy course "Advanced CSS and Sass" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
In this project I built a Realtor's single page website using CSS Grid and SCSS.


## Instructions

To visit website: http://nextergrid.surge.sh/

Or to use locally:

1. Clone or download the Repository.

2. In a terminal:

- Type `npm install`
- And then start with `npm start`

NOTE:
 This website is not built for Browsers that do not support CSS Grid, such as Internet Explorer.
 It can be viewed, just is not the intented layout.
